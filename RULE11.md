## To add your own mods to the list:

- Install a mod
- Rename the mod by adding `[NoDelete]` as a prefix to the name of the mod
  - E.g.: If you install `Mysticism`, rename it to `[NoDelete] Mysticism`
  - This prevents Wabbajack from deleting mods that you have added when you update the modlist
- You may also add this prefix to a mod whose configuration you may have changed, by altering an INI file for example
  - This will have the same effect as above, preventing Wabbajack from overwriting the mod (and your configuration) when you update the modlist
