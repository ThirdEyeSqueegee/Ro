Less is more. More is also more. Requires Anniversary Edition + Creation Club content.

Do you hate your PC? Do you want to see your CPU melt? Do you want to _truly_ benchmark your build? These are all rhetorical questions.

**Q**: "Why Ro and not {some modlist}?" <br>
**A**: Ro is focused on providing the best possible visual experience for Skyrim coupled with sensible gameplay overhauls that work together to make Ro a pleasure to look at and play.

Ro is an attempt to bring together the latest and greatest graphics mods and focused, true-to-vanilla gameplay overhauls including the full SimonRim suite. It's intended to look good and feel good without straying too far from the game we all know and love. Ro features extensive rebalancing, redistribution, and reduced cuts to make Anniversary Edition feel less clunky, the best graphical overhauls including Lux (+ Via and Orbis), Skyland AIO, **full widescreen/ultrawide support**, tons of beautiful new complex parallax textures, and Rudy's ENB for Obsidian Weathers.
