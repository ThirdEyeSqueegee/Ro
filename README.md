# Ro - A Balanced Modlist

## Simple, Stable(?), Sensible, Sexy

<br>

<br>

Less is more. More is also more. Requires Anniversary Edition.

NOTE: This is a **beta release**. As such, bugs and issues are to be expected and will be dealt with swiftly and with great prejudice. Please [report any issues/bugs](https://github.com/ThirdEyeSqueegee/Ro/issues) and help me make this modlist even more amazing than it already is!

Ro is an attempt to bring together the latest and greatest graphics mods and focused, true-to-vanilla gameplay overhauls including the full SimonRim suite. It's intended to look good and feel good without straying too far from the game we all know and love. Ro features extensive rebalancing, redistribution, and reduced cuts to make Anniversary Edition feel less clunky, the best graphical overhauls including Lux (+ Via and Orbis), Skyland AIO, tons of beautiful new complex parallax textures, and Rudy's ENB for Cathedral Weathers. All this with great performanceâ€”tuned out of the box to run smoothly with minimal frame drops.

Technical notes:

- Installation size: ~100 GB
- PC requirements: Probably something that was built within the last four years using parts that were released within the last four years.
