# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: "Why can't I wait using `T`?"

**A:** Hit `Tab` first, then `T`. Ro uses Wait Menu Redirected, which only allows for the wait menu to be invoked _after_ invoking the tween menu. This is to free up a keybind for controller players.

## Q: "Where can I find my crash logs?"

**A:** `Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE`
