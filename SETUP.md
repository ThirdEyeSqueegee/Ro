# First-Time Setup Instructions

## Do this BEFORE you launch the game

### H to Horse

- The default key to summon your horse is H. If you'd like to change the binding to a different key or a controller button, navigate to `H2Horse.ini` in the `[NoDelete] Press H to Horse - Custom Keybind` mod to change the keybind. Note that the keybind **cannot** be changed once you have started a save.

### Optional ENB

- There is an optional ENB preset provided under Optional Mods. If you'd like to use this, _first_ disable `Rudy ENB Obsidian Weathers Required Files` and `Rudy ENB for Obsidian Weathers`.

### Optional mods

- There are several optional mods under the Optional and Optional - Comedy separators. If you'd like to use them:
  1. In the right pane of ModOrganizer, click on the "plugins" tab and scroll all the way to the bottom. You should see `Occlusion.esp` at the end of this list.
  2. In the left pane of ModOrganizer, enable the optional mods you'd like to use.
  3. You'll see several new plugins pop up below `Occlusion.esp` in the right pane. Move these plugins **above** `DynDOLOD.esp`.
