# First-Time Setup Instructions

## Do this BEFORE you launch the game

- The default key to summon your horse is H. If you would like to change the binding to a different key or a controller button, navigate to `H2Horse.ini` in the `[NoDelete] Press H to Horse - Custom Keybind` mod to change the keybind. Note that the keybind **cannot** be changed once you have started a save.
- There are several optional mods under the Comedy separator. If you'd like to use them:
  1. In the right pane of ModOrganizer, click on the "plugins" tab and scroll all the way to the bottom. You should see `Occlusion.esp` at the end of this list.
  2. In the left pane of ModOrganizer, enable the optional mods you'd like to use.
  3. You'll see several new plugins pop up below `Occlusion.esp` in the right pane. Move these plugins **above** `DynDOLOD.esp`.

### MCM Configuration

- Go through the MCM settings and modify as you see fit, although everything has been preconfigured. You may want to look at the modpages for each mod before changing any settings.

### Character Presets

You'll find a mod called `[NoDelete] Ro - Character Presets` under the NPCs and Faces separator. You can save your RaceMenu presets to this folder!
