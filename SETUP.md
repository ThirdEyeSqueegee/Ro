# First-Time Setup Instructions

## Do this BEFORE you launch the game

### Required Reading

- [FAQ](/FAQ.md)
- [Keybinds](/KEYBINDS.md)

### Screen Resolution

- Set your screen resolution in `SSEDisplayTweaks.ini`, which can be found in the `SSE Display Tweaks` mod folder.

### H to Horse

- The default key to summon your horse is H. If you'd like to change the binding to a different key or a controller button, navigate to `H2Horse.ini` in the `[NoDelete] Press H to Horse - Custom Keybind` mod to change the keybind. Note that the keybind **cannot** be changed once you have started a save.

### Optional mods

- There are several optional mods under the `Optional - ...` separators. If you'd like to use them:
  1. In the right pane of ModOrganizer, click on the "plugins" tab and scroll all the way to the bottom. You should see `Occlusion.esp` at the end of this list.
  2. In the left pane of ModOrganizer, enable the optional mods you'd like to use.
  3. You'll see several new plugins pop up below `Occlusion.esp` in the right pane. Move these plugins **above** `DynDOLOD.esp`.
     - If you're using `Better Third Person Selection`, move it above Untarnished UI in the left pane of MO2.

## Do this AFTER you launch the game

### MCM Configuration

- Go through the MCM settings and modify as you see fit, although everything has been preconfigured. You may want to look at the modpages for each mod before changing any settings.
