### Framerate limit

- Set the framerate limit to your monitor's refresh rate (if using Lossless Scaling Frame Generation, set it to 1/2 or 1/3 of your monitor's refresh rate) in `SSEDisplayTweaks.ini`. The default limit is `55`, set up for use with Lossless Scaling 3x.

### Optional mods

- There are several optional mods under the `Optional - ...` separators. If you'd like to use them:
  1. In the right pane of ModOrganizer, click on the `Plugins` tab and scroll all the way to the bottom. You should see `Occlusion.esp` at the end of this list.
  2. In the left pane of ModOrganizer, enable the optional mods you'd like to use.
  3. You'll see several new plugins pop up below `Occlusion.esp` in the right pane. Move these plugins **above** `DynDOLOD.esp`.
