# First-Time Setup Instructions

## Do this BEFORE you launch the game

- This modlist uses [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962). Please skim through the modpage and familiarize yourself with the mod to avoid any confusion about starting your adventure.
- The default key to summon your horse is H. If you would like to change the binding to a different key or a controller button, navigate to `H2Horse.ini` in the `[NoDelete] Press H to Horse - Custom Keybind` mod to change the keybind. Note that the keybind **cannot** be changed once you have started a save.

### MCM Configuration

- Go through the MCM settings and modify as you see fit, although everything has been preconfigured. You may want to look at the modpages for each mod before changing any settings.

### Character Presets

You'll find a mod called `[NoDelete] Ro - Character Presets` under the NPCs and Faces separator. You can save your RaceMenu presets to this folder!
