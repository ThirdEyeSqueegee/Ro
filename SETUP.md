### Screen Resolution

- Set your screen resolution in `SSEDisplayTweaks.ini`, which can be found in the `SSE Display Tweaks` mod folder. The default resolution is `2560x1440`.
- Set the framerate limit to 1 less than your monitor's refresh rate (or half of your monitor's refresh rate if using Lossless Scaling) in `SSEDisplayTweaks.ini`. The default limit is 82, set up for use with Lossless Scaling's frame generation.

### Optional mods

- There are several optional mods under the `Optional - ...` separators. If you'd like to use them:
  1. In the right pane of ModOrganizer, click on the `Plugins` tab and scroll all the way to the bottom. You should see `Occlusion.esp` at the end of this list.
  2. In the left pane of ModOrganizer, enable the optional mods you'd like to use.
  3. You'll see several new plugins pop up below `Occlusion.esp` in the right pane. Move these plugins **above** `DynDOLOD.esp`.

### MCM Configuration

- Go through the MCM settings and modify as you see fit, although everything has been preconfigured. You may want to look at the modpages for each mod before changing any settings.
